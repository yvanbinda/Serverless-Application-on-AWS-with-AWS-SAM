# Step 3: Create a Serverless Application
## 3.1 Use AWS SAM CLI to Initialize a New Project
Navigate to your desired project directory:

      cd /path/to/your/project
      
Run the following command to initialize a new AWS SAM project:

		  sam init
o	Choose the template type (e.g., 1 for AWS Quick Start Templates).

o	Select a runtime for your functions (e.g., nodejs14.x for Node.js).

o	Provide a name for your project.
## 3.2 Project Structure Overview
After initializing the project, you'll see a directory structure similar to the following:
      my-serverless-app/
      
      |-- .aws-sam/
      
      |-- hello-world/
      
      |   |-- app.js
      
      |   |-- package.json
      
      |   |-- template.yaml
      
      |-- tests/
      
      |-- .gitignore
      
      |-- README.md
      
      |-- template.yaml

#### Let's discuss the purpose of each file and directory:
**aws-sam/:** This directory contains build artifacts and intermediate files generated during the build process.

**hello-world/:** This directory represents a Lambda function in your serverless application.

**app.js:** The code for your Lambda function.

**package.json:** Dependencies and metadata for the Lambda function.

**template.yaml:** AWS SAM template defining the resources associated with the function.

**tests/:** This directory can contain test cases for your serverless application.

**.gitignore:** A standard Git ignore file to exclude certain files and directories from version control.

**README.md:** A markdown file providing information about your project, how to deploy it, and any other relevant details.

**template.yaml:** The main AWS SAM template file for your serverless application.
Defines AWS resources such as Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB tables.

## 3.3 Modify the AWS SAM Template
**Open template.yaml in a text editor:** This file defines the AWS resources in your serverless application.

**Update the template as needed:** Modify the Resources section to add or adjust AWS resources.
Ensure the CodeUri property points to the correct location of your Lambda function code.

## 3.4 Update Lambda Function Code
**Open the Lambda function code file (e.g., hello-world/app.js):**
Update the code as needed for your application.

**Install dependencies (if using Node.js):**
	cd hello-world
	npm install
## 3.5 Build and Deploy the Serverless Application
**Build the application:** 

	sam build
 
This command compiles your application code and dependencies, preparing it for deployment.

**Deploy the application:**

	sam deploy --guided
 
 Follow the prompts to configure deployment settings interactively.
 
**Access the deployed resources:**

Once deployment is complete, AWS SAM CLI will provide the endpoint URLs for any APIs created.


You have successfully created a serverless application using AWS SAM. The AWS SAM CLI simplifies the process by providing a project structure and templates to get you started quickly. The generated AWS SAM template allows you to define and configure AWS resources for your application, and the CLI commands streamline the build and deployment process. In the next steps, we'll further define AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway, and other components in your serverless application.
