# Step 3: Define AWS Lambda Functions
## 3.1 Open Lambda Function Code
**Navigate to the directory containing your Lambda function code:**

    cd /path/to/your/project/hello-world
    
Replace /path/to/your/project with the actual path to your project.

**Open the Lambda function code file (e.g., app.js) in a text editor:**

This is where you define the logic for your Lambda function.

## 3.2 Update Lambda Function Code
**Modify the Lambda function code as needed:**

Add your business logic to the Lambda function. eg lambda function code in Node.js
    exports.handler = async (event) => {
        console.log("Received event:", JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
    
        // Your business logic goes here
    
        const response = {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
        };
    
        return response;
    };
    
Update the code based on the requirements of your serverless application.

Save the changes to the file.

## 3.3 Define Event Triggers (Optional)
**Navigate to the AWS SAM template (template.yaml) in a text editor:**

**Update the Resources section to include event triggers:**
      Resources:
      
        HelloWorldFunction:
        
          Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
          
          Properties:
          
            FunctionName: HelloWorldFunction
            
            Handler: app.handler
            
            Runtime: nodejs14.x
            
            Events:
            
              ApiEvent:
              
                Type: Api
                
                Properties:
                
                  Path: /hello
                  
                  Method: GET

In this example, an API Gateway event trigger is defined. The Lambda function will be triggered when an HTTP GET request is made to the /hello path.
Adjust the Path and Method properties based on your application's requirements.

## 3.4 Save and Deploy the Changes
**Save the changes to template.yaml.**

**Build and deploy the updated application:**

      sam build
      
      sam deploy
    
You have defined AWS Lambda functions in your serverless application. The Lambda function code contains the business logic for your application, and the AWS SAM template specifies the configuration, including event triggers. In this example, an HTTP GET request triggers the Lambda function through API Gateway.

Feel free to customize the Lambda function code and the AWS SAM template based on your application's requirements. In the next steps, we'll further configure API Gateway and other components of your serverless application.
