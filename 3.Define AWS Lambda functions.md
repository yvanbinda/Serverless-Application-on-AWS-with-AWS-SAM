# Step 3: Create a Serverless Application
## 3.1 Use AWS SAM CLI to Initialize a New Project
Navigate to your desired project directory:

      cd /path/to/your/project
      
Run the following command to initialize a new AWS SAM project:

		  sam init
o	Choose the template type (e.g., 1 for AWS Quick Start Templates).

o	Select a runtime for your functions (e.g., nodejs14.x for Node.js).

o	Provide a name for your project.
## 3.2 Project Structure Overview
After initializing the project, you'll see a directory structure similar to the following:
      my-serverless-app/
      
      |-- .aws-sam/
      
      |-- hello-world/
      
      |   |-- app.js
      
      |   |-- package.json
      
      |   |-- template.yaml
      
      |-- tests/
      
      |-- .gitignore
      
      |-- README.md
      
      |-- template.yaml

#### Let's discuss the purpose of each file and directory:
**aws-sam/:** This directory contains build artifacts and intermediate files generated during the build process.

**hello-world/:** This directory represents a Lambda function in your serverless application.

**app.js:** The code for your Lambda function.

**package.json:** Dependencies and metadata for the Lambda function.

**template.yaml:** AWS SAM template defining the resources associated with the function.

**tests/:** This directory can contain test cases for your serverless application.

**.gitignore:** A standard Git ignore file to exclude certain files and directories from version control.

**README.md:** A markdown file providing information about your project, how to deploy it, and any other relevant details.

**template.yaml:** The main AWS SAM template file for your serverless application.
Defines AWS resources such as Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB tables.
