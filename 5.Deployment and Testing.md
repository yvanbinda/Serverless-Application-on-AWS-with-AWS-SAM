# Step 7: Deploy the Serverless Application and Test
## 7.1 Deploy the Serverless Application
### 7.1.1 Open a Terminal
**Navigate to your project directory using the cd command:**

    cd /path/to/your/project
    
Replace /path/to/your/project with the actual path to your project.
### 7.1.2 Build the Application
Run the following command to build your serverless application:

  sam build

This command compiles your application code, dependencies, and prepares it for deployment.
### 7.1.3 Deploy the Application
Run the following command to deploy your serverless application:

  sam deploy

Follow the prompts to configure deployment settings.

Provide values for parameters such as stack name, region, and any other parameters defined in your AWS SAM template.

**Monitor the Deployment Process:**
The AWS SAM CLI will display the progress of the deployment.
You'll see information about the resources being created, updated, or deleted.

**Wait for Deployment Completion:**
The deployment process may take a few minutes. Wait for the process to complete.

**Access Outputs (Optional):**
After deployment, the AWS SAM CLI will display outputs, including endpoint URLs, DynamoDB table names, etc.
You can use these outputs to interact with your deployed resources.

### 7.1.4 Verify Deployment
**Check the AWS Management Console:**
Visit the AWS Management Console and navigate to the relevant services (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway) to verify that your resources have been created.

**Test the Endpoints:**
If you have an API Gateway, use the provided endpoint URL to test your API by making HTTP requests.

If you have Lambda functions, you can test them individually using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your serverless application using AWS SAM CLI. The deployment process involves building your application, creating or updating AWS resources based on your AWS SAM template, and making your application accessible via the defined endpoints.

Remember to verify the deployment by checking the AWS Management Console for the created resources and testing your application's functionality.

In the next steps, you can explore additional configurations, optimizations, and integrations to enhance your serverless application on AWS.

## 7.2 Test the Serverless Application
### 7.2.1 Test with cURL

**Invoke the API Endpoint:**
Use the cURL command to make a GET request to your API endpoint:

    curl -X GET https://your-api-gateway-url/prod/hello

Replace https://your-api-gateway-url/prod/hello with the actual endpoint URL provided during deployment.

**Verify the Response:** 
Check the response from the server. You should see a JSON response, for example: _{"statusCode":200,"body":"\"Hello from Lambda!\""}_
### 7.2.2 Test with Postman
**Open Postman:**
Open the Postman application on your local machine.
**Create a New Request:**
Click on the "New" button to create a new request.
Choose a name for your request (e.g., "Serverless App Test").

**Set Request Details:**
Set the request type to "GET."
Enter the API endpoint URL (e.g., https://your-api-gateway-url/prod/hello).

**Send the Request:**
Click on the "Send" button to make the GET request.

**Verify the Response:**
Check the response received in the "Body" section. You should see a JSON response, similar to what was received with cURL.

You have successfully tested your deployed serverless application by invoking the API endpoints using cURL and Postman. Testing the application helps ensure that the deployed resources are functioning as expected and that your serverless functions are responding correctly to HTTP requests.

Feel free to explore additional testing scenarios, such as sending different types of requests, testing error responses, and validating the integration with DynamoDB or other AWS services.
