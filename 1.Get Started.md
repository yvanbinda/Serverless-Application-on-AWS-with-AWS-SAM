# Get Started
## Step 1: Create a new AWS Lambda function
#### Navigate to AWS Lambda:
•	In the AWS Management Console, go to the "Services" dropdown.

•	Select "Lambda" under the "Compute" section.

### 1.1 Create a new Lambda function:
•	Click on the "Create function" button.

•	Choose "Author from scratch."

•	Provide a name for your function, choose a runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python etc)
• Set up the execution role. create a new role with basic Lambda permissions.

#### Configure triggers (optional):
•	Add triggers if needed. For simplicity, you can skip this for now and add triggers later.
**Write your Lambda function code:**
•	In the "Function code" section, write or upload the code for your Lambda function.

•	Click "Save" to save your Lambda function.

### 1.2 Create an API Gateway
**Navigate to API Gateway:**

•	In the AWS Management Console, go to the "Services" dropdown.

•	Select "API Gateway" under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section.

**Create a new API:**

•	Click on the "Create API" button.

•	Choose "HTTP API" for simplicity.

•	Provide a name for your API and click "Create API."

**Create a resource and method:**

•	Under the "Develop" section, select "HTTP API" and then "Routes."

•	Click "Create Resource" to define a resource (e.g., "/items").

•	Create a method (e.g., GET) for your resource.

**Integration with Lambda function:**

•	In the method settings, choose "Lambda Function" as the integration type.

•	Select the Lambda function you created earlier.

•	Save the configuration.

**Deploy your API:**

•	Under the "Stages" section, click on "Create."

•	Choose a name for your stage (e.g., "prod") and deploy your API.

### 1.3 Create a DynamoDB table
**Navigate to DynamoDB:**

•	In the AWS Management Console, go to the "Services" dropdown.

•	Select "DynamoDB" under the "Database" section.

**Create a new table:**

•	Click on the "Create table" button.

•	Provide a name for your table.

•	Define a primary key (e.g., "id") and choose the data type.

**Configure settings:**

•	Adjust the table settings as needed (e.g., provisioned capacity, auto-scaling).

•	Click "Create" to create your DynamoDB table.

**Note your table details:**
•	Once the table is created, make a note of the table name as you'll need it in your Lambda function code.

At this point, you've set up the foundational components for your serverless application on AWS. You have a Lambda function, an API Gateway, and a DynamoDB table. In the next steps, we'll further develop the serverless application by defining Lambda functions, API Gateway configurations, and DynamoDB interactions.
